# Freewheelin website

## Stream 1 Mileston Project - User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is a website for a local inclusive dance company. The website provides information regarding all aspects of Freewheelin from staff and class times to contact details and donations, thus 
making it a useful tool to demonstate the many tools and skills I have picked up so far on the course.

## Demo

A live demo of the website can be found [here](https://francisillingworth.github.io/milestone-project-1/index.html)\

## UX

The goal of my design was to create a welcoming website with the primary goal of attracting new members to the dance company. It should be a place where
prospective newcomers dont feel intimidated, be that by information overload, harsh visual design and blunt language.\
To do this I have created a minimalist design where each page contains small amounts of the most important information.
The idea behind this was to not overload the visitor and put them at a sense of ease.
This thought process also translated into all aspects of the page. Elements are all rounded not just to feel
fun but also to be neutral and welcoming as opposed to harsh baxes with sharp boxes (you will notice only the youtube clip on index.html has real square corners- 
these were kept because of peoples familiarity with the format of youtube videos).
I also chose a pastel color palate to create something both bright but also welcoming, I also feel it fits in with modern styles in web development where softer colours
are favoured over harsher brighter colours.
\
Bringing all these points together this website aims to be as friendly and welcoming as possible. The main barrier to gaining new members to the dance comapny is the fear 
people have of coming down for the first time as they dont know people, what to expect etc. By putting people at ease on the website I hope to create a friendly
vibe around Freewheelin immediately so there is less trepidation about making the leap and coming down to a class for the first time.

## Technologies

HTML5
CSS3
Bootstrap v.4.3.1

## Features

The site features:
1) The bootstrap grid system layout.
2) A burger icon nav link that is responsive with the page nav bar so neither ever appear at the same time.
3) 2x bootstrap modals. One for registering to be contacted about a donation, One for sending an email with questions about classes.
4) Embedded responsive maps and videos.
5) Resonsive icon links that are hover sensitive using font awesome icons and hover.css from Github

### Features left to implement

There are a few features that I would like to implement further down the line. 
1) A picture carousel on index.html and a gallery page containing photos and videos of performances.
2) An online payment platform (e.g paypal) on the donation link as opposed to registering and getting someone to contact you about a donation.
3) I'd like to add a page about future an past performances as well as news.


## Testing

The website has been tested extensively on android phones and tablets as well as iOS devices (iphone and ipad) with a font change to sans-serif required to run on iOS.
The website also runs smoothly on multiple browsers (chrome, firefox and safari).

All links to external sites open on new tabs to avoid visitor being navigated away from the website. all intenal links open within the same tab.

There are required fields in both the donate and contact us forms that will stop the form being submitted without being completed with an accompanying error message with the fault stated. The email sections also require an email address (@)to
be entered before allowoing form submission.

## Deployment

The website is hosted by GitHub Pages and is deployed from the master branch.
