# Freewheelin website

## Stream 1 Mileston Project - User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is a website for a local inclusive dance company. The website provides information regarding all aspects of Freewheelin from staff and class times to contact details and donations, thus 
making it a useful tool to demonstate the many tools and skills I have picked up so far on the course.

## Demo
